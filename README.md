# Not a Bug Xmas edition

This repository contains `backend`, `frontend` and `fimrware` parts of the mighty Xmas tree we built during the Not a Bug Xmas edition.

You can control your Xmas lights animations with a special panel and enqueue animations that will be consumed by a special circuit.

Feel free to open a PR 🎁
